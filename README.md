## **OVERVIEW**

### **Site Plan**
<br>E-commerce website built using Django to showcase learning outcomes from my Code Institute course. The website is for a once-real, but now defunct (due to moving countries), actual business that sold artisan candles. This iteration presumes the business is being restarted and now branching into other lifestyle products.

While technically fake, this may serve as a jumping-off point for a new website for this business or, at the very least, a test bed to ideate from, as we plan to restart the business now that we are settled in Ireland.

The design concept is somewhat in keeping with the original site and the existing but dormant Facebook page. It should be an e-commerce site that focuses on a small inventory of items, with high customer engagement and feedback in the form of a review system and wishlist.

Visually, it should be modern, clean, and styled to suit a lifestyle brand.

## **Manual Testing**
All user stories marked as 'done' on our project board [HERE](board-link-here) were tested and signed off.

<br />

I did not have time to implement automated or unit tests. As the project is relatively straightforward I opted for manual testing. The results can be seen below.

--------------------------------------------------------

EDIT THIS
## **DEPLOYMENT**

* Code was written in Gitpod by creating a repo from the initial CI full template [HERE](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Org/gitpod-full-template)
* ### Forking the repository
  * A copy of the GitHub Repository can be made by forking the GitHub account. This copy can be viewed and changes can be made to the copy without affecting the original repository. Take the following steps to fork the repository;
  * Log in to GitHub and locate the repository.
  * On the right-hand side of the page in line with the repository name is a button called 'Fork', click on the button to create a copy of the original repository in your GitHub Account.

<br />

* ### Cloning the repository
  * Under the repo’s name, click on the code tab.
  * In the Clone with HTTPS section, click on the clipboard icon to copy the given URL.
  * In your IDE of choice, open Git Bash.
  * Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory to be made.
  * Type git clone, and then paste the URL copied from GitHub.
  * Press enter and the local clone will be created.

<br />

* ### Deploying to Heroku
  * Create working Procfile
  * Ensure requirements.txt is up to date with pip freeze --local > requirement.txt - Vital so that Heroku knows what packages and dependencies are being used.
  * In our env.py files we use 'noqa' to stop error for long line, this was ok to leave as it not deployed to Heroku.
  * An ignore file is used with an env.py file to prevent secure data from being published to git.
  * Make sure to set debug to "DEBUG = 'DEVELOPMENT' in os.environ" so that Heroku will not run in debug mode.
  * Make sure the current working branch is up to date and pushed to GitHub correctly.
  * Login to Heroku using 2 step authentication.
  * Once logged create a new app in Heroku.
  * Set the config vars of the new app in heroku to reflect the dependencies in the app (see below).
  * Link the app to our GitHub repo (see below).
  * This was then deployed manually to ensure control over the live version.
  * You do this by navigating to the deploy tab and selecting manual or automatic.
  * Check the build log for a successful build.
